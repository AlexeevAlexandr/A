                    <p>It is sometimes difficult to find available information for beginners.
                        Some authors have a very deep understanding of the language,
                        and beginners cannot understand their explanations.
                        This doesn't mean that the author has written poorly,
                        it means that novice programmers cannot understand this yet.</p>
